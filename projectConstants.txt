STATEMENT 6 :❖
DESCRIPTION :
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based AI-powered resume
optimization tool that can:
Parse resumes from different formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
Compare the content with job descriptions to identify key skills, job
requirements, and missing keywords.
Provide personalized suggestions on improving the resume’s content,
structure, and formatting for better alignment with job requirements.
Offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface for job seekers, allowing them to
upload their resumes easily and receive actionable feedback.
➢
There is a need for a smart, web-based tool that can assist job seekers by analyzing
their resumes, comparing them against job descriptions, and providing AI-driven
suggestions to improve content, formatting, and alignment with specific job roles. This
tool should be able to identify missing skills or keywords, propose better phrasing, and
ensure the resume is tailored to specific job opportunities, improving the chances of
passing through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and impressing recruiters.
